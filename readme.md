# Animal Tracker Project

This project aims at building an application able of classifying animal observation pictures (*e.g.* pictures of animal, tracks, scats, etc.) for education purposes.

We will base or model on the AWS open dataset from [iNaturalist](https://github.com/inaturalist/inaturalist-open-data) containing tens of millions of wildlife observations.

Our model will be trained on Kaggle to enable GPU acceleration.
